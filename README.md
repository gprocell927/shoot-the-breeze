This is a chat app created by [Graham Nessler](https://github.com/gness1804) and [Gabrielle Procell](https://github.com/gprocell927) while at the Turing School of Software and Design. The app accepts messages from multiple users, who log in via Google using [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Users can see and respond to other messages in the chat room, see who else is in the chat room, and log out at any time. Users can also filter messages by user and by message text.
